## What is the experiment and what I expect from it

I have always been interested in experiments and traveling, so I started an
original experiment by leaving books in airports and train
stations back in 2016. Unfortunately, I have never received a message from
anyone so far. I decided to change it a bit and give it another try.

Traveling is a big part of my life and I thought connecting people through
traveling and books without even meeting would be an awesome idea.

I thought it would be an interesting experiment, I could display some charts and
maps with the data about them, if it happened to be successful.

My new approach is to create a chain reaction where every person that receives
the book will actually send it to someone else they know. I am curious to see
how far will it get and how many different locations will it travel to.

It might reach a point where the book is stuck with someone that cannot find
someone else to send it to, so I need to have a backup list with addresses that I
can share with said person so the book can continue its journey.

If you want to be part of it just send me an email with you address. Your address
will only be shared with that person and will never be available anywhere
online. Fair warning, this will require national or international postage
fees.

## The book

![Around the World in 80 Days](/assets/aroundtheworldbook/aroundtheworld.jpg)

[Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54479.Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days)

The book I have chosen is a classic and it matches perfectly the theme of the
presented experiment. In this case Phileas Fogg is the book itself and there is
no time limit.

## Website

As the book arrives to new destinations and I get notified about it, I will
update the website with the new location and the overall journey on a map.
Hopefully, after some time, I'll have enough data to do some analysis as well.

This experiment depends on the collaboration of the people. If you have any suggestions please let me know!

## First (failed) version of the experiment

The original experiment consisted of leaving a book with a message of what to do
on a bench in a public place. The person who would take it would read the book,
then leave it somewhere else in a public place for someone else to pick up and
repeat the process. I also included an email address for people to contact me so
I would know each location of the books. It didn't work, so I decided to change
my approach. It was a hitchhiking approach for the book and I was not aware of
similar experiments until recently.

Books I left in public places for people to pick up and do the same, let me know
if you know of someone who might have found it, would be interested to know if
it worked but just didn't get notified about it:
