![Headshot](/assets/headshot.png){:class="headshot"}

I am Marius, a Software Developer from Europe. I have lived in Braila, Madrid and Dublin.

I would describe myself as a highly motivated, independent and curious person. My passion is writing code and I like drawing/painting (digital and oil on canvas), photography, travelling, reading and music. I would like to travel around the world some day.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@MariusAvram91){:target="_blank"}, [Github](https://github.com/mariusavram91){:target="_blank"}, [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mariusavram91){:target="_blank"} and [Linkedin](http://ie.linkedin.com/in/mariusavram91){:target="_blank"}.

### Winter of '91 and where I come from

Born in 1991, just two years after the [Romanian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revolution){:target="_blank"}, I grew up in a small town next to the Danube river, in Muntenia region (historically called [Wallachia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallachia){:target="_blank"}).

### Romania

Romania's population is estimated at twenty million. It is situated in Southeast Europe and its capital is Bucharest, also known as Little Paris.

Yes, I know... Count Dracula's country. Well, Dracula is actually just a Bram Stoker [fictional character](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17245.Dracula){:target="_blank"} based on Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia and ruler in mid 15th Century, as known as [Vlad the Impaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler){:target="_blank"} (he impaled many Ottomans). Quite a sadistic fellow if you would ask me, even by those times' standards, although he is considered a hero in Romania for fighting the corrupted rich people. Fact: He was born in Transylvania, but never lived there, and he did die, unlike Stoker's Dracula, so no, that's not his castle, get over it.

We had a long period of time of [Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Romania){:target="_blank"}, which took over after World War II and ended in the Romanian Revolution of December 1989.

We like arts, literature, science, cuisine, sports and very old [traditions](http://romaniatourism.com/traditions-folklore.html){:target="_blank"} are still high regarded.

It is a very [beautiful country](http://www.wherecoolthingshappen.com/22-photographs-prove-that-romania-is-beautiful){:target="_blank"} and I would strongly recommend you to visit it. Very nice landscape, Carpathians especially, and very tasty food.

### How did I get into computers?

I have always been curious about how things worked, sometimes I would prefer to open a remote car toy just to see how it works than play with it.

One year, at my school, they were giving computer courses and my parents immediately decided I should take that course. When I saw a PC for the first time I fell in love with it. Couldn't wait for the each week's class, I would ask the teacher about everything and I would always take notes. Unfortunately, it was really hard to have one at home under our circumstances. The class ended after the first year and didn't see another computer for years.

A few years later, my parents emigrated to Spain and sent me a laptop. I have to say I was really happy. It was great to learn on my own how everything worked, breaking things and fixing them, always gaining more knowledge.

Then, when I also moved to Spain, I got a better computer and took some programming classes at school.

### Painting, drawing and photography

Drawing and painting were my favourite activities. I always had a notebook and a pencil with me and drew anything I saw, especially from a dictionary I had that had lots of pictures and other books. I was getting fairly good at it, or so I was told. I also took some oil painting classes a teacher was giving at school every afternoon and I enjoyed it greatly.

I stopped for a few years and, when I decided to try again, I rediscovered it was pretty exciting. I decided to buy a graphics table and give a try to digital drawing/painting.

Another activity I enjoy is [Photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariusavram){:target="_blank"}. If you would like to see some of my art, please go to the [Gallery](/gallery).

### Big change I

Two years after my parents relocated to Madrid, my sister and I also moved there. It was a big change for both of us, culturally and due to the language barrier. We adapted fast, learning Spanish easily (I learnt some on my own before moving) and making friends. I enjoyed my Internet connection extremely and tried to build an HTML/CSS website.

I decided I wouldn't go to college but take two years vocational course about Telecommunications and IT. I loved it, I learnt about telephony, television and video editing, electronics, networking, Linux, programming and much more.

### Starting to be a professional

I had an internship of three months at a [company](http://wirelessmundi.com){:target="_blank"} that was developing a PHP Web application and I tried to learn the most from them in that short time. After the internship finished, I had my first diving in the entrepreneurship world. Two friends and I started a "company" which would make websites and fix computers, after long time waiting we had our first client and, unfortunately, the last one. We redesigned and built the company's website.

After some time interviewing for a real job, I was hired at a company in Madrid, Classis, as a PHP Developer and Support Assistant. I did my best and learnt a lot during my time there.

### Big change II

The [company](http://learningdata.ie){:target="_blank"} was bought, after six months, by a Dublin based bigger company and I was asked if I wanted to move to Dublin. Once again, I was moving to a completely new place, this time on my own. I arrived to Dublin excited, motivated and ready for a new challenge.

### Back home

Finally, after saving money while in Dublin, I booked a flight to Romania for the first time since I left. I was thrilled by this trip, as were my relatives and childhood friends.

### Travelling and languages

It might be very clich√©, but I love travelling and I wish I would do it more.

I visited US, specifically Las Vegas and San Francisco, while I volunteered at [CollisionConf](https://collisionconf.com){:target="_blank"} 2015. Visiting San Francisco was a dream coming true, I've always wanted to see the Golden Gate bridge with my own eyes, not sure why though. Well, I did it, and how I did it... I walked all day from Downtown, through the China Town, then going to SF-Oakland Bay bridge, to Embarcadero, to Pier 39 until evening, when I arrived to the Golden Gate Bridge. Waited there till the sunset. It was astonishing and the very long walk was worth it!

During the 2015 summer I went on an Interrail trip for 10 days, flying from Dublin to Berlin, then taking the train, I visited Amsterdam, Geneva, Vienna and Prague, then flying back to Dublin. It was one of the greatest experiences of my life. What I most liked was the sudden change between the different cultures and languages.

Talking about languages, I like to learn them. Speaking Romanian, learning English and French at school, then learning Spanish on my own and when I moved to Madrid, also trying to learn German. I would also like to learn either Chinese or Japanese.

### Why programming?

Although I learnt many things during the vocational course, I really liked programming. We started with C and then, in a team of 4 at the end of the course, I worked on a final project using PHP, MySQL and IIS, yes, IIS, please don't judge us.

I liked building things people would use, creating something from "nothing" and solving puzzles and problems. Who wouldn't want to be a detective looking for impossible to find bugs and always learning something? It's rewarding and challenging and that's why I love it!

I love [Python](https://www.python.org){:target="_blank"}. Python is simple, fun to write and very readable. There is no other language with so many scientific libraries. Its community is very passionate, engaging, inclusive and supportive.

### Gear

I am currently using a Lenovo Thinkpad T450s with Ubuntu as OS, I prefer Gnome Classic to other desktop environments. I enjoy using Vim to write code, it is very efficient.
