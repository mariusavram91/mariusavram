## Instructions

1. We'll start by peeling and weighting the carrots. We need {{ page.carrots }} of **peeled carrots**, which we will grate. Preferably a mixture of small and big pieces. Leave it aside.

### Wet mixture

1. We'll start by making the flax-eggs. In the small bowl, mix {{ page.flaxseeds }} of flaxseeds and {{ page.water }} of water. Leave the mixture aside for at least 10 minutes.
2. While waiting for the flax-egg to thicken, mix the rest of the wet ingredients. Add {{ page.applesauce }} of **apple sauce** into a blender or a big (1L or more) cup, then add {{ page.acid }} of **vinegar or lemon juice**. Add {{ page.oil }} of your prefered **oil**, {{ page.maplesyrup }} of **maple syrup** or sugar, and {{ page.sugar }} of **sugar**.
3. Once the flax-egg thickened, add it to the mixture of wet ingredients.
4. Then use a blender or hand blender to **blend it all until smooth**. _Or until most of the sugar has melted._

Start the oven at **170 degrees Celsius, top and bottom**.

### Dry mixture

1. Sift {{ page.flour }} of **all-purpose flour**, {{ page.cornstarch }} of **cornstarch**, {{ page.bakingpowder }} of **baking powder**, {{ page.bakingsoda }} of **baking soda**, {{ page.cinnamon }} of ground **cinnamon**, {{ page.nutmeg }} of ground **nutmeg**, and {{ page.cloves }} of ground **cloves**  in a big mixing bowl.
2. Then, use a **whisk to mix everything well**.

Take a **30cm round baking pan and spray with some non-stick spray**, or use some oil to coat it. Then, cover the inside of the pan with flour. Leave it aside.

### Batter

4. **Pour the blended mix over your dry mixture** and use a rubber spatula to mix everything slowly. **Don't overmix**, or you'll develop too much gluten, resulting in dense and deflated cake. Try to break apart any flour lumps and stop when you cannot see any more dry ingredients. _That is why we blended the other ingredients separately._
5.  Very gently fold in the grated carrots ({{ page.carrots }}) to the batter.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared round pan. _Tap the pan gently against the counter to get a nice cake texture by removing the air bubbles (which make the cake drier)._

### Baking

1. Place the pan in the preheated oven, **lower middle rack**. _Leave enough space over the pan so the top doesn't burn._
2.  Set a timer for **30 minutes** then go make the **frosting**.
3. After 30 minutes, take it out of the oven and do the **toothpick test**. _Simply insert a toothpick in the middle of the pan. If the toothpick comes out with wet batter, take it back to the oven and bake it for 5 to 10 minutes more. Otherwise, stop the oven._
4. Let the cake **cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes**, then remove the cake from the pan and place it on a cooling rack.

### Frosting

1. In a big mixing bowl, add the {{ page.butter }} of **vegan butter** and use the hand mixer to make it light and fluffy.
2. Then add the {{ page.lemonjuice }} of **lemon juice** and {{ page.creamcheese }} of **cream cheese** and mix it all until combined.
3. Slowly add the {{ page.powdersugar }} of sifted **powdered sugar** while mixing.
4. Mix everything at medium speed until it is light and fluffy.
5. Place the bowl with the frosting in the fridge until the cake has completely cooled down.

### Assembly

Once the cake has cooled down, add the frosting on top with the spatula, then add the amount of coconut flakes to your taste (optionally mixed with chopped walnuts).

Keep it refrigerated.


Enjoy!
