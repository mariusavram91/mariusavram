## Instructions

### Wet mixture

1. We'll start by mixing the wet ingredients. Add {{ page.milk }} of **milk** into a blender or a big (1L or more) cup, then add {{ page.acid }} of **vinegar or lemon juice** to the milk, mix it, and let it sit for 5 minutes.
2. While you wait for the milk to become buttermilk, peel bananas and take {{ page.bananas }} of **peeled bananas**, then add it to the buttermilk mix.
3. Add {{ page.oil }} of **oil**, {{ page.maplesyrup }} of **maple syrup** or sugar, and {{ page.sugar }} of **sugar** to the buttermilk-bananas mix.
4. Use a blender or hand blender to **blend it all until smooth**. _Or until most of the sugar has melted._

Start the oven at **170 degrees Celsius, top and bottom**.

### Dry mixture

1. Sift {{ page.flour }} of **all-purpose flour**, {{ page.cornstarch }} of **cornstarch**, {{ page.bakingpowder }} of **baking powder**, {{ page.bakingsoda }} of **baking soda**, and {{ page.cinnamon }} of **cinnamon** in the big mixing bowl.
2. Optionally add {{ page.nutmeg }} of **nutmeg** to the dry mix. Then, use a **whisk to mix everything well**.

Take a **30cm baking loaf pan and spray with some non-stick spray**, or use some oil to coat it. Then, cover the inside of the pan with flour. Leave it aside.

### Batter

4.  **Pour the blended mix over your dry mixture** and use a rubber spatula to mix everything slowly. **Don't overmix**, or you'll develop too much gluten, resulting in dense and deflated cake. Try to break apart any flour lumps and stop when you cannot see any more dry ingredients. _That is why we blended the other ingredients separately._
5.  Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. _Tap the pan gently against the counter to get a nice cake texture by removing the air bubbles (which make the cake drier)._

It's time to add whatever **toppings** you want. Chop some walnuts and/or banana chips and spread them gently on top of the batter.

### Baking

1.  Place the pan in the preheated oven, **lower middle rack**. _Leave enough space on top of the pan so toppings don't burn._
2.  Set a timer for **50 minutes**.
3.  After 50 minutes, take it out of the oven and do the **toothpick test**. _Simply take a toothpick and insert it in the middle of the pan. If the toothpick comes out with wet batter, take it back to the oven and bake it for 5 to 10 minutes more. Otherwise, stop the oven._
4.  Let the bread **cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes**, then remove the cake from the pan and place it on a cooling rack.

Let it cool completely before serving. Or just dig in! :)

Enjoy!
