Hi! I am Marius, a Software Developer.

This is the beginning of a blog which will hopefully help you as much as it will help me. It will contain walkthroughs, news about software and projects I will be working or I am excited about, stories, commentaries or thoughts.

I am doing this as a way improve my writing skills, as well as my English and have a sort of reports on new acquired knowledge. Please, feel free to make constructive critics on anything and let me know what I should improve, rewrite of fix.

Thank you for your patience, with my English and writing skills, if you didn't give up with this post. You are welcomed back for my next blog posts.

You can always share my posts links and [subscribe to my RSS feed](/feed.xml), if you wish.
