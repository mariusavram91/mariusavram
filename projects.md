I like building things people can use, creating something from “nothing” and solving puzzles and problems. Who wouldn’t want to be a detective looking for impossible to find bugs and always learning something new? It’s rewarding and challenging and that’s why I love it!

A few projects I've worked on:

## Web Applications

A School Management Information System, a multi tenant web application, written in a custom PHP framework. Running on Apache, MySQL for database and Git for version control.

It is a complete student tracking, reporting and information management. A different instance is deployed for each school.

* I have delivered multiple features and improvements for backend, frontend and infrastructure. I've added Capistrano to automate the deployments to each of or all instances. Implemented various API integrations for file sharing, such as Dropbox and Google Drive, and information synchronisation with Active Directory and MSSQL databases, as well as the integration with Schoolbag.

* Created XML and XSLT templates for school reports.

* I migrated our instances to Azure and managed them. I added monitorisation and automatisation.

#### **Classis API** 2016

![classisapi](/assets/projects/classis_api.jpg){:class="project"}

A REST API written using Flask Python framework and its web client written in Javascript/jQuery.
