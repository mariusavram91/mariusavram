    <p>
      I really enjoy bouldering and climbing, which helps me get a fresh
      perspective on things. I spend a lot of time with my dogs in nature, as
      well as teaching them tricks. Both activities, climbing and dog training,
      involve a lot of problem solving and finding creative solutions which
      relate in many ways to coding. Aditionally enjoy being in the kitchen,
      trying out new recipes and baking all sorts of desserts.
