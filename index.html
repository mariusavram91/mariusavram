      I enjoy <strong>bouldering and climbing</strong>, which helps me get a
      fresh perspective on things whenever I feel stuck. I spend a lot of time
      with my dogs in nature and I love teaching them tricks. Both activities,
      climbing and <strong>dog training</strong>, involve a lot of
      problem-solving and finding creative solutions, which relate in many ways
      to coding. Additionally, I enjoy spending time in the kitchen, trying out
      new recipes and <strong>baking</strong>.
