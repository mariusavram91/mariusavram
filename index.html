      I enjoy <strong>bouldering and climbing</strong>, which helps me get a
      fresh perspective on things. I spend a lot of time with my dogs in nature
      and teaching them tricks. Both activities, climbing and
      <strong>dog training</strong>, involve a lot of problem-solving and
      finding creative solutions, which relate in many ways to coding.
      Additionally, I enjoy spending time in the kitchen, trying out new recipes
      and <strong>baking</strong> all sorts of desserts.
