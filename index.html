      I really enjoy <strong>bouldering and climbing</strong>, which helps me
      get a fresh perspective on things. I spend a lot of time with my dogs in
      nature and teaching them tricks. Both activities, climbing and
      <strong>dog training</strong>, involve a lot of problem-solving and
      finding creative solutions, which relate in many ways to coding.
      Additionally, I enjoy spending time in the kitchen, trying out new recipes
      and <strong>baking</strong> all sorts of desserts. Some recipes you can
      find
      <a href="{{ '/recipes/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
        ><strong>here</strong></a
